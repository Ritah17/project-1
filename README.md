# DATA SCIENCE JOB MARKET ANALYSIS

Project title
Data Science Job Market Analysis: Salary Trends by Location and Seniority.

Objective
To analyze data science job salaries across different locations and levels of seniority, uncovering how compensation varies for various data roles (e.g., Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer).

Dataset
Source: Kaggle (cleaned the dataset using excel)
Content: 670+ job postings
Fields include
• Job Title
• Location (City, Province)
• Seniority
• Avg Salary (min, max, avg)
• Company Info
• Work Type

Tools used
• Microsoft Excel
• Pivot Tables
• Charts (Column, Pie)

Data cleaning steps
- Removed rows with missing salary or location values
- Cleaned “Company Name” to remove ratings
- Split salary ranges into Min, Max, and Avg salary columns
- Created new columns for City and Province
- Replaced `-1` and nulls in fields like Competitors, Revenue
- Removed line breaks from text fields
  
Analysis performed
Created pivot tables to calculate average salaries by:
  - Job Title
  - City
  - Seniority
  - Work Type
- Ranked cities by job count and average compensation
- Identified which seniority levels earn the highest salaries
- Compared average salaries between remote and on-site jobs
  
Visualizations
Created pivot tables to calculate average salaries by:

Key finding
- Senior-level and management data roles earn 2–3x more than entry-level positions
- Major cities like Toronto and Vancouver offer higher salaries, but cost of living may offset gains
- Remote jobs offer competitive salaries, especially for senior roles
- Data Engineers and ML Engineers top the salary list compared to Data Analysts
  
Conclusion
This analysis helps job seekers understand how role type, seniority, and location impact salary. It also guides employers on competitive compensation across the Canadian data science market.
